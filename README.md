SQL scripts:

Creation of views for Finance & SaaS KPIs (MRR, ARR, Churn, NRR, Delinquency, Collections, Marketing attribution).

Analytical views combining Customers, Subscriptions, Invoices, Charges, Plans, and UTM Sources.

Scripts for aging analysis, churn decomposition, marketing efficiency, and cash vs accrual revenue.

Exploratory analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Simple visualizations: boxplots, distributions, churn curves.

User and role provisioning scripts

These must be created and managed directly by administrators in the Snowflake account.
This repo only includes analytical logic (SQL views, Python checks).

üöÄ Usage

Connect to your Snowflake environment.

Run the SQL scripts in the order defined to create analytics views.

Use the Python notebooks inside Snowflake Worksheets (or Snowpark) for validation and exploratory analysis.

Connect your BI tool (e.g., Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI) to the schema with these views.

üìä Key Outputs

Finance KPIs: MRR, ARR, Cash Collected, Churn, NRR, ARPU.

Collections & Risk: Invoice aging, Delinquency %, Charge success rate.

Marketing Attribution: MRR by UTM Source & Campaign, Trial vs Paid conversion.

Product Metrics: Revenue by plan, Plan migration, Product-level churn.
